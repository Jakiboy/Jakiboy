### Hi there ‚úã

*I am Jihad Sinnaour Aka (JS / Jakiboy), a software engineer based in Marrakech, Morocco. I obtained my MSc in 2017, and I have been passionate about software engineering since I was 15 years old. I started my journey with Reverse Engineering, including Assembly, OllyDbg, and Hiew, and progressed to C/C++ programming.*

*I began my professional career in 2014 as a Web Developer, specializing in WordPress development. Through my work, I developed a passion for PHP and have since become an expert in the language.*

*In terms of my strengths, I am highly motivated, and I have a keen eye for detail. I am also a quick learner and am always seeking to expand my knowledge in the field of software engineering.*
